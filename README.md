## 🗒️ Description

**Memetopia** is a fast-paced game where you climb an endless tower while battling crazed memes. The goal is simple: **🤞survive as long as possible, 🤺 defeat enemies, and 💰collect Doge Coins** to boost your score. The game ends when time runs out, and your score is calculated based on the memes defeated, coins collected, and seconds survived.

#### 60 seconds? Enough time to make history... or crash and burn.
